This project contains two parts: PyBank and PyPoll

Each folder contains three folders: 

* A file called `main.py`. This contains the main script to run for each analysis.
* A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV file used. 
* An "analysis" folder that contains a text file with the results of the analysis.

## PyBank
This script analyzes the financial records of the company to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
